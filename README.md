## Arrays and
[1.1](./chapter01/1.1/IsUnique.cpp) **Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

[1.2](./chapter01/1.2/CheckPermutation.cpp) **Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

[1.3](./chapter01/1.3/URLify.cpp) **URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with `%20`. You main assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,  please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
